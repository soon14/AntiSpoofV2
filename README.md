# AntiSpoofV2
 AntiSpoofV2 Framework with Yolov7. Currently working to refactor with Yolov9 model.

 This is a real-time framework for anti-spoofing. Both thermal and visual inputs are simultaneously utilised. The Yolo model is trained on both visual/thermal images, hence only a singular model is needed for detection/tracking.

 Next steps will include further additional validation steps with homographic transformation of the separate plans onto each other adn cross-validating detected facial landmarks.

 This will eventually be refactored to utilise Yolov9, but the base framework will be maintained. More specifically, the type of filters we use.
